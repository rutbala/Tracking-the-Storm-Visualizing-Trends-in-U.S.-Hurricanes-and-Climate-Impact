# Tracking-the-Storm-Visualizing-Trends-in-U.S.-Hurricanes-and-Climate-Impact

Introduction:-

This project explores decades of hurricane data to analyze trends in their frequency, intensity, and geographic distribution. Utilizing advanced visualization techniques such as geospatial overlays, temporal trends, and multivariate scatterplots, the study reveals critical insights into hurricane dynamics, including relationships between wind speed and pressure. These findings offer actionable knowledge for climate research, disaster preparedness, and policy development.

The project demonstrates the power of data visualization in transforming raw data into compelling narratives, bridging the gap between science and actionable solutions for global challenges like climate change.

Methodology:-

In this project, we employed a range of advanced data visualization techniques to uncover insights into hurricane trends:

1. Geospatial Overlays: Mapped hurricane trajectories and hotspots to visualize geographic distribution.

2. Temporal Trends: Used time-series plots to analyze hurricane frequency and intensity over decades.

3. Multivariate Scatterplots: Explored relationships between variables like wind speed, pressure, and storm categories.

4. Heatmaps: Highlighted regions with high hurricane activity.

5. KDE Plots and Boxplots: Visualized seasonal variations and intensity distributions.
