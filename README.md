# Tracking-the-Storm-Visualizing-Trends-in-U.S.-Hurricanes-and-Climate-Impact

Introduction:-

This project explores decades of hurricane data to analyze trends in their frequency, intensity, and geographic distribution. Utilizing advanced visualization techniques such as geospatial overlays, temporal trends, and multivariate scatterplots, the study reveals critical insights into hurricane dynamics, including relationships between wind speed and pressure. These findings offer actionable knowledge for climate research, disaster preparedness, and policy development.

The project demonstrates the power of data visualization in transforming raw data into compelling narratives, bridging the gap between science and actionable solutions for global challenges like climate change.
